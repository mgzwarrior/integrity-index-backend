## Coding Standards

We follow industry best practices for Python development. Please review our detailed coding standards in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md), which include:

### Key Guidelines

- **Python Style:** Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Type Hints:** Use type annotations for all function signatures
- **Imports:** Group and sort imports (standard library, third-party, local)
- **FastAPI Best Practices:** RESTful endpoints, Pydantic models for validation
- **Database:** Use SQLAlchemy ORM with async operations
- **Testing:** Write unit tests with pytest, aim for 80%+ coverage
- **Security:** Never hard-code credentials, validate all inputs

### Code Quality Tools

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff:** For linting, formatting, and import sorting
- **pytest:** For running tests
- **pre-commit:** To automatically run checks before commits

All contributions are automatically checked by our CI pipeline when you submit a pull request.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Add or update tests as needed
   - Follow the coding standards outlined above

3. **Run pre-commit checks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork and submit a pull request:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the changes
